                <h1>About Me</h1>
    
                <p>Welcome to my personal website, where I'm excited to share my journey with you. My passions span a diverse spectrum, from the exhilarating world of coding to the enchanting realm of books and the joy of exploring new places.</p>
    
                <p>I'm Krishna Dulal, currently pursuing a degree in Computer Science with a specialization in Software Engineering at the prestigious University of Virginia (UVA). Originally from the beautiful country of Nepal, my educational voyage began here. I completed my high school education in Nepal before delving into the world of education itself. I spent around a year as a math teacher, igniting curious minds back in my homeland.</p>
    
                <p>However, the pursuit of higher education and new horizons led me to the United States. My initial academic steps on this journey were taken at Northern Virginia Community College, where I solidified the foundational skills that have become the bedrock of my passion for technology.</p>
    
                <p>At UVA, I've had the privilege of engaging with a vibrant academic community that fosters innovation. I've undertaken various projects and coursework that have honed my skills in software development, including creating applications with Django, Flask, and Java. I've also ventured into the world of database management, gaining proficiency in SQL.</p>
    
                <p>Outside of academia, I've excelled in various roles, including as a Sales Manager at Virginia ABC, where I demonstrated exceptional leadership and multitasking abilities. I've also completed a web development internship, where I worked on projects supporting corporate strategy and honed my skills in web development, including building a personal portfolio website like this one.</p>
    
                <p>As I continue to tread the path of learning and exploration, I eagerly anticipate the challenges and triumphs that lie ahead. Each experience is shaping a future that amalgamates my diverse interests and ambitions into a meaningful and impactful journey.</p>
